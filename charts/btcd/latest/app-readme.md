# btcd

[Bitcoin](https://btcinformation.org/) uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks;
managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network.

This chart bootstraps a single node btcd deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.
